<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>Main article: History of the World Wide Web
In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee developed the foundation for the
Web- HTTP, HTML, a browser, a server, and the first website
in order to manage documentation at CERN.
While the Web was a success at CERN, it was not very popular
elsewhere. In two years, there were only 50 websites.
After the NCSA released Mosaic, a graphical browser that could
display inline images[6] and submit forms,[7] and HTTPd, a
server that could process forms (see CGI), the Web became very
popular with thousands of websites springing up in less than a
year.
In 1994, Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape and
released Navigator which introduced Java and Javascript to
the Web. It quickly became the dominant browser. In 1995,
Netscape had a very successful IPO which triggered a frenzy
for the Web and started the dot-com bubble.
Microsoft responded by developing their own browser, Internet
Explorer. By bundling it with Windows, it became the dominant
browser for 14 years.
Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
which created XML in 1996 and recommended replacing HTML with
stricter XHTML.
In the meantime, developers began exploiting an IE feature
called XMLHttpRequest to make Ajax applications and launched
the Web 2.0 revolution.
Mozilla, Opera, and Apple rejected XHTML and created the
WHATWG which developed HTML5.
In 2009, the W3C conceded and abandoned XHTML and in 2019,
ceded control of the HTML specification to the WHATWG</p>
